# Style and Documentation

We generally follow the [mathlib style for coding and documentation](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html), so please refer to that.

Feel free to use variable names that make sense in the domain that you are dealing with. For example, in the `LTS` library, `State` is used for types of states and `Î¼` is used as variable name for transition labels.
